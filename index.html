        <h1>Russian Revolution</h1>
        <h2>what is russian revolution ?</h2>
        <p>The Russian Revolution took place in 1917, during the final phase of World War I. It removed Russia from the war and brought about the transformation of the Russian Empire into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), replacing Russia's traditional monarchy with the world's first Communist state.</p>

        <h2>Economy and society in russian revolution</h2>
        <p>The economic causes of the Russian Revolution largely originated in Russia's slightly outdated economy. Russia's agriculture was largely based on independent peasants, who seldom owned modern machinery.</p>
        <h2>Socialism in Russia</h2>
        <p>The Russian Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 7 November 1917 (October Revolution) as a sovereign state and the world's first constitutionally socialist state guided by communist ideology. The first Constitution was adopted in 1918.</p>
        <h2>A TURBULENT TIME: THE 1905 REVOLUTION</h2>

        <h2>The first world war and the russian empire</h2>
        <p>Russia entered World War I in the three days succeeding July 28, 1914 — beginning with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia, a Russian ally.

        <h2>the february revolution in petrograd</h2>
        <p>In Russia, the February Revolution (known as such because of Russia's use of the Julian calendar) begins when riots and strikes over the scarcity of food erupt in Petrograd. ... By 1917, most Russians had lost faith in the leadership ability of the czarist regime.</p>
        <h2>Women in the Russian Revolution</h2>
        <p>Peasant women also took on new roles, taking over some of their husbands' farm work. Women fought directly in the war in small numbers on the front lines, often disguised as men, and thousands more served as nurses. The social conditions of women during World War I affected the role they played in coming revolutions</p>
        <h2>After february revolution</h2>
        <p>The failures of the Provisional Government led to the October Revolution by the Communist Bolsheviks later that year. The February Revolution had weakened the country; the October Revolution broke it, resulting in the Russian Civil War and the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.</p>
